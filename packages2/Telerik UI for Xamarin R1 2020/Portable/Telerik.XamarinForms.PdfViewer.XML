        <member name="M:Telerik.XamarinForms.PdfViewer.PdfPageCacheManager.BeginUsingPage(System.Int32)">
            <summary>
            Loads the page, i.e. document.CacheManager.BeginUsingPage is called and the IDisposable
            object is cached. This allows features like selection and annotations to work.
            In case there is an error while loading the page, i.e. when the
            BeginUsingPage method throws an exception, then loading has failed, so the page is not in use.
            See the <see cref="M:Telerik.XamarinForms.PdfViewer.PdfPageCacheManager.IsUsingPage(System.Int32)" /> method.

        <member name="M:Telerik.XamarinForms.PdfViewer.PdfPageCacheManager.IsUsingPage(System.Int32)">
            <summary>
            Checks if the page is loaded, i.e. that BeginUsingPage was called with no exceptions
            and that the IDisposable object is cached. See the <see cref="!:TryBeginUsingPage" /> method.
            </summary>
            <returns>A value indicating whether the page is successfully loaded.</returns>

        <member name="T:Telerik.XamarinForms.PdfViewer.PdfViewportUtils">
            <summary>
            This class exists because the meaning of Viewport in v1 and v2 of the PdfViewer is different. 
            In v1 the Viewport's scroll is dependent on the zoom, and its size is the same as the size of the presenter.
            Also in v1 a root-size-helper is used which distorts the page size.

        <member name="T:Telerik.XamarinForms.PdfViewer.Selection.CustomPdfSelectionIndicator">
            <summary>
            This class is a POC for a potential extensibility point - custom selection indicators.
            Some API changes must be done before the base PdfSelectionIndicator is made public.
            Also take into consideration how to make it possible to set stroke and stroke thickness.
